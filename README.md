This is a space to save this as I've found it useful to track information on Cookie clicker to know how far it is to get to the next acheivement in th very end of th game (95%+ progress).

It will create a blue bar that can be clicked on to copy the data in Pipe delimited format

# how to use

2. make a bookmark of *any webpage* - ideally in the bookmarks bar for convenience
3. edit the bookmark and change the url to the data from step 1
4. then on cookie clicker pages, click your bookmark
5. click on the "copy updated values" link at the bottom-left, and you have the data to parse out into the spreadsheet of your choice
